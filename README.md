# Oroe Defence Bot

A small Discord bot that automatically defends **Oroe** whenever:
- someone says "oroe" or "oreo" in chat, or
- someone tags Oroe directly, or
- someone replies to the bot's own defence message.

## Features

- Random defence banter lines (British / chaotic / church meme / IMVU energy).
- Special replies when people argue with the bot itself.
- Configurable response chance so it doesn't spam on every message.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/oroe-defender-bot.git
cd oroe-defender-bot
